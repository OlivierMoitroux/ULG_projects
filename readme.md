# List of projects.


Each branch hosts a project that I did during my studies (up to now ) of computer engineering (focus on intelligent systems). The description and listing is still TODO.
## Master 1

* *Integrated software project*:  ```isp```
    * Agile development of a proof of concept for a car sharing mobile app. 
    We had to develop a solution so that the user doesn't need to enter 
    manually all its habbits. Instead, we developped an independant app with
     some algorithms to acquire data of the user in background so that it 
     could send pre-processed data to our backend where we analyzed the 
     travel data more in depth in order to extract relevant habbits from the
      travels of the user. These habbits are then displayed on the app 
      thansk to a REST API. Use of Jira to monitor all the dev. Flutter (dart)
      /Play
       (Java)/PostGresSQL
* *Compilers*: ```vsopcompiler```
    * A compiler developped from scratch in C/C++. Compiles code from vsopc to llvm. Use of byson and yacc.

* *Artificial intelligence*: ```IA```
    * 3 assignments were returned, all of them consisting in driving pacman
     in 
    the maze. They were directly inspired from the [Berkeley pacman environment](http://ai
    .berkeley.edu/project_overview.html). The 
    first one was to overview several graph traversals technique to explore 
    the env. without any ghost and maximizing the score ("time to eat them 
    all"). The second project integrates ghosts (adversarial setup). The 
    third one investigates Bayes filtering to design a radar that helps 
    pacman avoiding ghosts. Python.
    
* *Linear Control systems*: ```LCS```
    * We had to design a PID and a frequency controller on a subject of 
    choice in Matlab. We decided to control an inverted pendulum (~segway).
    
* *Reinforcement learning*: ```RL```
    * A1: Problem statement of a RL grid exploration problem, modelisation 
    as a markov decision process, batch Q-learning
    * A2: Optimization of car acceleration on a continuous car on the hill 
    problem. Use of fitted Q, parametric Q-learning. Python.
    * A3: Continuous fruit catcher game. Use of Fitted Q, Q-learning, Deep 
    Q-learning, Double deep Q-learning with replay buffer, Deep 
    deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)
