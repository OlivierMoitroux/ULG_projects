# List of projects.


Each branch hosts a project that I did during my studies (up to now ) of computer engineering (focus on intelligent systems). The description and listing is still TODO.
## Master 1

* *Integrated software project*:  ```isp```
    * Agile development of a proof of concept for a car sharing mobile app. We had to develop a solution so that the user doesn't need to enter manually all its habbits. Instead, we developped an independant app with some algorithms to acquire data of the user in background so that it could send pre-processed data to our backend where we analyzed the travel data more in depth in order to extract relevant habbits from the travels of the user. These habbits are then displayed on the app thansk to a REST API.
* *Compilers*: ```compilers```
    * A compiler developped from scratch in C/C++. Compiles code from vsopc to llvm. Use of byson and yacc.
