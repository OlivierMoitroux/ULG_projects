# List of projects.


Each branch hosts a project that I did up to now during my studies of computer engineering (focus on intelligent systems).

## Master 1

* *Integrated software project*:  ```isp```
    * Agile development of a proof of concept for car sharing mobile app. We had to develop a solution so that the user don't need to enter manually all its habbits. Instead, we develop an independant app with some algorithms to analyse the habbits of the user in background so that it could send pre-processed data to our backend where we analyzed the travel data more in depth to extract relevant habbits of the user. These habbits are then displayed on the app thansk to a REST API.
* *Compilers*: ```compilers```
    * A compiler developped from scratch in C. Compiles code from vsopc to llvm. Use of byson and yacc.
    
* *Artificial intelligence*: ```IA```
    * 3 assignments were returned, all of them consisting in driving pacman
     in 
    the maze. They were directly inspired from the [Berkeley pacman environment](http://ai
    .berkeley.edu/project_overview.html). The 
    first one was to overview several graph traversals technique to explore 
    the env. without any ghost and maximizing the score ("time to eat them 
    all"). The second project integrates ghosts (adversarial setup). The 
    third one investigates Bayes filtering to design a radar that helps 
    pacman avoiding ghosts.
